# Real-time Human Pose Estimation in the Browser with TensorFlow.js

Pose estimation is one of the computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and video, so that one could determine, for example, where someone’s elbow shows up in an image. To put it simply, this technology is not recognizing who is in an image — there is no personal identifiable information associated to pose detection. The algorithm is simply estimating where key body joints are.
# Assumption 
I still need to develop the User Interface and so this project is on going.
